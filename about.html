            <p> <h6>AN EVER YOUNG COMMUNITY</h5> <br>
                A&T started up in 1991 with a clear international mission and with the intention of dressing young people who are engaged with their environment, <br> who live in the community and relate to each other. Young people who have a casual dress sense, <br> who shun stereotypes and who want to feel good in whatever they are wearing. <br> To meet their needs, A&T takes the latest international trends, mixing them with the influences that are seen on the street and in the most fashionable clubs, <br> and reworks them according to their style thus turning them into comfortable and easy to wear garments. <br>
                
                A&T evolves at the same pace as its customer, always watching out for new technologies, social movements and the latest artistic or musical trends. <br> All of this can be seen reflected not only in its designs but also in stores. <br> Inspired by the legendary Californian city of Palm Springs, the product lines are constantly being updated. All stores worldwide receive new merchandise twice a week. <br>
                
                A&T is present in 76 markets through a network of more than 970 stores and the online store.
